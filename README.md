A React web app, that allows users to generate and download memes using the memegen.link website.

planned features:

- [ ] Enter text for the top and bottom of the meme
  - [ ] The top text box needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Top text`
  - [ ] The bottom text box needs to have a label element associated with it with the text `Bottom text`
  - [ ] Both text boxes should be empty when the page first loads
- [ ] Preview the generated meme
  - [ ] The image element needs to have an html attribute set as follows: `data-test-id="meme-image"`
    - [ ] This image element should show a working image when the page first loads
- [ ] Change the meme template (the background image)
  - [ ] The meme template selector element needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Meme template`
  - [ ] If the user follows the steps below, the `doge` meme template needs to be selected:
    1. Click on the label of the meme template selector
    2. Clear any existing value (eg. with a text box)
    3. Type the text `doge`
    4. Hit enter
- [ ] Download the meme by clicking on a button
  - [ ] The button element needs to contain the text `Download`
